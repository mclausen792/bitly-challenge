# Software Engineering Internship Challenge
## Language
- JavaScript

## Purpose
- I created two bitlinks for coding conferences that are happening this summer, you can tell the history of the links and how many times they have been clicked
- I also created this [ugly site](https://coding-conferences.firebaseapp.com/) to make visiting the links more convenient.

## Running the App
- Clone this repo
- Run npm install in your terminal
- Run node index.js in your terminal from inside the public directory
